{
    /**
     * Represents the data approval state transitions from a current state
     * representing the combined state of all periods tested so far, combined
     * with the state of a new period, resulting in the next current state.
     * <p>
     * When checking states for a number of periods where all other selection
     * criteria are the same, the states will always be in one of three
     * mutually exclusive categories:
     * <ul>
     * <li>UNAPPROVABLE</li>
     * <li>Approvable elsewhere states:
     *     UNAPPROVED_ELSEWHERE,
     *     PARTIALLY_APPROVED_ELSEWHERE,
     *     APPROVED_ELSEWHERE,
     *     ACCEPTED_ELSEWHERE,
     *     PARTIALLY_ACCEPTED_ELSEWHERE
     * </li>
     * <li>Approvable here states:
     *     UNAPPROVED_WAITING,
     *     UNAPPROVED_READY,
     *     PARTIALLY_APPROVED_HERE,
     *     APPROVED_HERE,
     *     PARTIALLY_ACCEPTED_HERE,
     *     ACCEPTED_HERE
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * We don't have to worry about state transitions between these
     * categories; they will not exist. We need only consider state
     * transitions within each of the categories. (And we don't have to
     * consider state transitions within the first category since there
     * is only one state.)
     * <p>
     * The state transitions are coded in a MapMap. Conceptually, they
     * form a triangular matrix (minus the diagonal) like the following,
     * where "*" shows the entries:
     * <pre>
     *
     * current A  B  C  D  E
     *  new A  .  *  *  *  *
     *      B  .  .  *  *  *
     *      C  .  .  .  *  *
     *      D  .  .  .  .  *
     *
     * </pre>
     * The diagonal is not required because when the current and new states
     * are the same, the next current state will be the same as both.
     * The lower triangle of the matrix is not required because the
     * matrix is tested both ways: current (columns) - new (rows), and also
     * current (rows) - new (columns) (The matrix dimensions are commutative.)
